# Data Preprocessing

There are my 5 homeworks done in winter semester 2018/19 for a subject called "Data Preprocessing" done during my Erasmus at Faculty of Information Technology at Czech Technical University in Prague.
The code is written in Python in a tool Jupyter for writing an executable code with some fancy visualisation of comments.

Homeworks are mainly about some techniques of preprocessing the data to prepare it for some machine learning techniques.

Previously I stored this code in my private repository at the gitlab of FIT CVUT in Prague, but after passing this course succesfully I can upload it to my public repository.
